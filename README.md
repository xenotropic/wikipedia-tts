# wikipedia-tts
Scripts gluing together TorToiSe with text preprocessing with the goal of getting clean audio readings of Wikipedia articles. Waaay alpha use with caution.
I'm using this with runpods.io.

The initial command to your empty server (as sudo or root) is

`cd /workspace && git clone https://github.com/xenotropic/wikipedia-tts && ./wikipedia-tts/runpodinit.sh`

Where /workspace is whatever directory you want your repos and models in.
